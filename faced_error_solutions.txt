Node Multer unexpected field
Answers:

The <NAME> you use in multer's upload.single(<NAME>) function must be the same as the one you use in <input type="file" name="<NAME>" ...>.

So you need to change

var type = upload.single('file')

to

var type = upload.single('recfile')

in you app.js

#mongodb connection error 
connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
Answers:
This happened probably because the MongoDB service isn't started. Follow the below steps to start it:

Go to Control Panel and click on Administrative Tools.
Double click on Services. A new window opens up.
Search MongoDB.exe. Right click on it and select Start.
The server will start. Now execute npm start again and the code might work this time
